# Japanese Dev Lingo

Different wordlists with examples for software developers working in Japanese.

As part of my career as a Software Developer in Japan, I have joined a team where Japanese is used internally. At that moment I had a level areound the N2 but only used Japanese casually with my Japanese friends and for everyday's life.

It was a challenge to get used to all the vocabulary and expressions used in this field. While the Japanese language uses a lot of english loanwords (*gairaigo*), the engineering field uses an astonishing high amount of native Japanese words (*wago*) and this can be surprising.
